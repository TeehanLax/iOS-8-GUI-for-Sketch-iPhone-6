# iOS 8 GUI for Sketch (iPhone 6)

## Make good stuff

The Sketch file is well organized, labeled, layered and full of editable shape
layers. Most people find it useful for mocking up apps. Others use it to concept
ideas or create custom interface elements that work harmoniously with those
native to iOS. Whatever your use, we hope you enjoy it.

Before you get started, youâ€™ll want to become acquainted with some of the
support documentation that Apple has put together over at
[developer.apple.com](http://developer.apple.com/)
(login required). PDFs like the iOS HIG, UI Transition Guide and UI Catalog will
help you become familiar with how and when to use these elements.
